Starting with the Fall 2019 offering of CS 224W, the course covers three broad topic areas for understanding and effectively learning representations from large-scale networks: preliminaries, network methods, and machine learning with networks. Subtopics within each area correspond to individual lecture topics.

## Preliminaries

1. [Introduction and Graph Structure](preliminaries/introduction-graph-structure): Basic background for graph structure and representation
2. [Measuring Networks and Random Graphs](preliminaries/measuring-networks-random-graphs): Network properties, random graphs, and small-world networks
3. [Motifs and Graphlets](preliminaries/motifs-and-structral-roles_lecture): Motifs, graphlets, orbits, ESU

## Network Methods

1. [Structural Roles in Networks](): RolX, Granovetter, the Louvain algorithm
2. [Spectral Clustering](network-methods/spectral-clustering): Graph partitions and cuts, the Laplacian, and motif clustering
3. [Influence Maximization](network-methods/influence-maximization): Influential sets, submodularity, hill climbing
4. [Outbreak Detection](network-methods/outbreak-detection): CELF, lazy hill climbing
5. [Link Analysis](network-methods/pagerank): PageRank and SimRank
6. [Network Effects and Cascading Behavior](network-methods/network-effects-and-cascading-behavior): Decision-based diffusion, probabilistic contagion, SEIZ
7. [Network Robustness](): Power laws, preferential attachment
8. [Network Evolution](): Densification, forest fire, temporal networks with PageRank
9. [Knowledge Graphs and Metapaths](): Metapaths, reasoning and completion of KGs


## Machine Learning with Networks

1. [Message Passing and Node Classification](machine-learning-with-networks/message-passing-and-node-classification): Label propagation and collective classification
2. [Node Representation Learning](machine-learning-with-networks/node-representation-learning): Shallow, DeepWalk, TransE, node2vec
3. [Graph Neural Networks](machine-learning-with-networks/graph-neural-networks): GCN, SAGE, GAT
4. [Generative Models for Graphs](machine-learning-with-networks/graph-generative-models): GraphRNN
